# Reflection on our way of working
Based on the Essence checklist, we'd say that our way of working is currently in the **In Place** state. All team members follow the practices and tools that we have agreed upon, such as Git, to perform the work, and everyone has access to the necessary resources, such as our GitHub repository. Furthermore, all team members are actively involved in inspecting and adapting our workflow to fit the context of the given assignment. However, since we have limited prior experience using Git in a team project, we are still learning and refining how to use these tools effectively. This explains why we don't consider ourselves to have reached the “Working Well” state yet, where practices and tools would be applied seamlessly and naturally. We are continually giving each other feedback and we discuss our way of working openly, improving step by step.
